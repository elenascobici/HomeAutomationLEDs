--- DESCRIPTION ---
This project is designed to receive commands from OpenHab over WiFi and to then parse through the command to execute the proper LED light pattern.


--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
Make sure to move the libraries folder to whichever directory you have set as your library folder in Arduino.

The LEDLightsAtmega file was written for the Arduino Atmega 2560 board and the UDPforLEDS was written for the Arduino ESP8266 Wifi Module. However, they may work with other boards; the former works with the Arduino UNO board.


--- WORK IN PROGRESS ---
This project is not complete!
There are more presets being added at the moment.
